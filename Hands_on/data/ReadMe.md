# An example with larger dataset to test on laptop

Go to this link and download New York taxi data from Kaggle (there are more updated versions that you can find online) `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elemento/nyc-yellow-taxi-trip-data?resource=download`. The downloaded file as of June 6, 2025, named `yellow_tripdata_2015-01.csv` is **1.84GB** with 12,748,986 rows. I made 7 copies of the same file in my hard disk so in total I have **14.7GB** of data with 101,991,888 rows (for 8 files).
